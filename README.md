This is a draft work in progress project.This application revolves around providing students with the opportunity to access discounted groceries. The core concept involves collaborating with grocery and supermarket chains, enabling them to offer their products at lower prices, particularly those nearing their expiration date or items with lower turnover rates. Students can log in to the application, browse the available items, and purchase them at a discounted rate. This not only benefits students economically but also addresses the issues of food waste and carbon emissions associated with discarded items.

The primary goal is to create a sustainable solution by optimizing the consumption of grocery items that are still within their consumption timeframe. While the primary focus is on students, the application is accessible to the general public. However, the pricing for non-student users will be slightly higher than the discounted rates provided to students. This dual-access approach aims to strike a balance between catering to the student demographic and extending the benefits to a wider audience, fostering a more sustainable and inclusive solution for grocery shopping.
